## Introduction
X-ray security inspection machines have been widely used in traffic safety scenes such as airports and customs. With the rapid development of society, the requirements for the speed and accuracy of security inspection are becoming higher and higher. However, the traditional X-ray image judgment has always depended on manual work, with low quality and efficiency, long time-consuming, high requirements for the experience of the cartographer, and the problem of missing inspection occurs. These problems require the use of automatic object detection algorithm in X-ray security detection to improve the detection and response time of human operators. 

A high-quality dataset is the cornerstone of a deep learning model with excellent performance.   A smaller number of datasets containing enough X-ray images with annotation has always a major obstacle to object detection in the actual security inspection work.   Thus, we construct a large-scale X-ray image dataset, i.e. CGDXray, to promote the solution of the above problem for more researchers to study.   We will introduce the detailed information about this benchmark.
## CGDXray for Xray Object Detection
We mainly collected X-ray images generated by security inspection machines from real scenarios such as subways, high-speed railways, etc. Due to the scarcity of extremely dangerous contraband goods in daily life, we also hired some volunteers to keep putting packages containing different contraband goods on the conveyor belt of the security machine in our laboratory to collect corresponding X-ray images. Six security machines produced by different manufactures were used in the data collection process, so there are six kinds of X-ray images with different styles. The X-ray images generated by different machines are different in color, size, etc. Figure 2 displays X-ray images from six different domains.
